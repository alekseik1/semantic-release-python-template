Semantic release test project
=============================

This project aims to show how Semantic Release can be configured with Python.


Drawbacks
---------

The major problem of Semantic Release is that is cannot run if master/main branch has new commits.
This makes it complicated to release from a trunk with high commit cadence.
See `Issue <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1208>`_ for discussion.
